## Wanna know about us?

Good for you! That seems a great start.

Well, if you are here for seeking big big words for an unbelievable technological
mambo jambo, you are in the wrong place dude. We are a bunch of people who
actually don't know what they are really doing. What a good starting point, huh?
The only sticky feeling in our stomach is the hunger of learning and the passion
of producing (I mean, apart from becoming rich). Honestly, when we kicked of this
initiative, it had been a couple weeks since we had learned what the NFT really
is. (Hope you don't ask for a description of it though. We still feel like
granpas who are trying to understand the internet.) 

While checking our products, be careful that there is not artifical intelligence
behind, we are still not that cool. (By the way, are there still people who are
impressed by the word "Artifical Intellegence"? Really?) So, when you aim to
collect any item from where the hell they are (which is [here][buynow]), always
keep in mind that there are plenty of manual artwork, or just work, behind. They
are more like handmade rugs in the cyrpto world.

It's really good for us if you are still keep reading this bullshit till this
point. I assume we took your attention. So we will keep telling. We wanna make
you to live the whole story with us, step by step. Why we have started, what we
have discovered, how we have handled... There are maaaany things behind the
scenes where you most probably think we are either so smart or fucking stupid
while you are reading. And if you really wonder, have a look at the
"[HA's Shitboard Logs][] ".    

So, if you are still looking for an answer why you should buy an item from
Hipster Animals gang shop, I suggest you to go and ask the guys "[Sofia][sofia]"
and "[MoonFunkyMonkey][]", as they are the first ones who have collected some
animals in the first days, and we still don't know why they did it. 

Or just do not overthink, go get the shit man. 

Cyryptoly yours,

Hipster Animals
