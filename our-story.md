## Wanna know about us?

Good for you! That seems a great start.

Well, if you are here for seeking big big words for an unbelievable technological
mambo jambo, you are in the wrong place dude. We are a bunch of people who
don't really know what they are doing. What a good starting point, huh? The only
sticky feeling in our stomach is the hunger of learning and the passion of
creating (I mean, apart from becoming rich). Honestly, when we kicked off this
initiative, it had been a couple of weeks since we had learned what NFT really
is. (Hope you don't ask for a description of it though. We still feel like
granpas who are trying to understand the internet.)

## What do we do?

While checking our NFTs, be careful that there is not artifical intelligence
behind, we are still not that cool. (By the way, are there still people who are
impressed by the word "Artifical Intelligence"? Really?) So, when you aim to
collect any item from where the hell they are (which is [here][HipsterDogs]),
always keep in mind that there are plenty of manual artwork, or just work,
behind. They are more like handmade rugs in the cyrpto world.

## How will this evolve?

It's really good for us if you are still keep reading this bullshit till this
point. I assume we took your attention. So we will keep telling. We wanna make
you to live the whole story with us, step by step. Why we have started, what we
have discovered, how we have handled... There are maaaany things behind the
scenes where you most probably think we are either so smart or fucking stupid
while you are reading. And if you really wonder, have a look at the
"[HA's Shitboard Logs][] ".

## Why should you buy an Hipster Animal?

So, if you are still looking for an answer why you should buy an item from
Hipster Animals gang shop, I suggest you to go and ask the guys "[Sofia][]"
and "[MoonFunkyMonkey][]", as they are the first ones who have collected some
animals in the first days, and we still don't know why they did it.

Or just do not overthink, go get the shit man.

Cyryptoly yours,

Hipster Animals
