## Wanna know about us?

Good for you! That seems a great start.

Well, if you are here for seeking big big words for an unbelievable
technological mambo jambo, you are in the wrong place dude. We are a bunch of people who actually don't know what they are really doing. What a good starting point, huh? The only sticky feeling in our stomach is the hunger of learning and the passion of producing (I mean, apart from becoming rich). Honestly, when we kicked of this initiative, it had been a couple weeks since we had learned what the NFT really is. (Hope you don't ask for a description of it though. We still feel like the granpas who are trying to understand the internet.) 

While checking our products, be careful that there is not artifical intelligence behind, we are still not that cool. (By the way, are there still people who are impressed by the word "Artifical Intellegence"? Really?) 
So, when you aim to collect any item from where the hell they are (which is [here][link1]), always keep in mind that there are plenty of manual artwork, or just work, behind. They are more like handmade rugs in the cyrpto world.

It's really good for us if you are still keep reading this bullshit till this point. I assume we took your attention. So we will keep telling. You will continuously living our story while creating new ideas. Our aim is to tell the whole process transperantly on our each step. What we have discovered, how we handled, what are the tries and fails...
